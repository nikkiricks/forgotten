# Privacy Compliance Documentation

## Legal Basis for Account Discovery Processing

This document outlines the legal framework and compliance measures for the Account Discovery feature in accordance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable privacy regulations.

### Legal Bases Under GDPR Article 6

#### 1. Legitimate Interest (Article 6(1)(f))
**Primary Legal Basis for Family Members**

- **Interest**: Digital legacy management and estate administration for deceased persons
- **Necessity**: Account discovery is necessary to identify digital assets for proper estate management
- **Balancing Test**: 
  - Legitimate family need to manage deceased's digital presence
  - Uses only publicly available information
  - Minimal data processing with automatic deletion
  - Strong privacy safeguards implemented

**Documentation**: Each request documents the requester's relationship and legitimate interest

#### 2. Legal Obligation (Article 6(1)(c))
**For Legal Representatives and Executors**

- **Obligation**: Court-appointed executors have legal duty to identify and manage all assets
- **Scope**: Applies when requester has formal legal authorization
- **Documentation**: Legal status verified and recorded with each request

### California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Compliance

#### Public Information Exception
- **CCPA ยง 1798.140(o)(2)**: Information lawfully made available from federal, state, or local government records
- **Application**: Social media platforms make certain profile information publicly searchable
- **Scope**: Only processes information already publicly available

#### Household Exception
- **CCPA ยง 1798.145(a)(1)**: Personal information collected in the course of a household activity
- **Application**: Family members managing deceased relative's digital assets
- **Limitation**: Strictly limited to family/household context

### Data Processing Principles

#### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
```javascript
// All processing documented with legal basis
const searchData = {
  legalBasis: 'legitimate_interest_family', // Required field
  relationship: 'immediate-family',        // Verified relationship
  purpose: 'digital_legacy_management'     // Explicit purpose
};
```

#### 2. Purpose Limitation
- **Primary Purpose**: Digital legacy management for deceased persons
- **Secondary Use**: Prohibited - data cannot be used for other purposes
- **Scope Limitation**: Only searches for deceased persons, not living individuals

#### 3. Data Minimization
```javascript
// Minimal data collection
const sanitizedResults = {
  platform: profile.platform,
  url: profile.url,
  confidence: profile.confidence,
  // Personal details removed for storage
  hasName: !!profile.name,
  hasProfileData: !!(profile.bio || profile.title)
};
```

#### 4. Accuracy
- **Confidence Scoring**: All matches include accuracy confidence levels
- **User Verification**: Results presented for human verification
- **Error Correction**: Users can report inaccuracies

#### 5. Storage Limitation
```javascript
// Automatic 7-day deletion
const RETENTION_DAYS = 7;
const expirationDate = new Date(Date.now() + (RETENTION_DAYS * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
```

#### 6. Integrity and Confidentiality
- **Encryption**: All stored data encrypted at rest
- **Access Control**: Unique search IDs prevent unauthorized access
- **Audit Logging**: All data processing activities logged

### Data Subject Rights Implementation

#### Right to Information (GDPR Art. 13-14)
- **Privacy Notice**: Comprehensive notice provided before processing
- **Transparency**: Clear explanation of data sources and methods
- **Contact Information**: Privacy contact provided for inquiries

#### Right of Access (GDPR Art. 15)
```javascript
// API endpoint for data access
app.get('/api/discover-accounts/:searchId', async (req, res) => {
  const results = await dataRetentionService.getDiscoveryResults(searchId);
  // Returns all processed data for the search ID
});
```

#### Right to Erasure (GDPR Art. 17)
```javascript
// User-initiated deletion
app.delete('/api/discover-accounts/:searchId', async (req, res) => {
  const deleted = await dataRetentionService.deleteDiscoveryResults(searchId, 'USER_REQUEST');
  // Immediate permanent deletion
});
```

#### Right to Rectification (GDPR Art. 16)
- **Correction Process**: Users can report inaccurate results
- **Update Mechanism**: Confidence scores can be adjusted based on feedback

#### Right to Object (GDPR Art. 21)
- **Opt-out Process**: Users can object to processing based on legitimate interests
- **Immediate Stop**: Processing stops immediately upon valid objection
